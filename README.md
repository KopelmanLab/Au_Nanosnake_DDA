#Au_Nanosnake_DDA

Welcome to the Kopelman laboratory folder for nanosnake DDA computations. Each folder has a scripts for different key functions involving DDA analysis. In short, folders involve:

1.) Shape file geometry generation
2.) DDSCAT output spectral interpolation 
3.) DDSCAT job submission via Linux utilizing multiprocessing (# of cores can be customized)
