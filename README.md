#Au_Nanosnake_DDA

Welcome to the Kopelman laboratory folder for nanosnake DDA computations. Each folder has a scripts for different key functions involving DDA analysis. In short, folders involve:

1.) Shape file geometry generation

2.) DDSCAT output spectral interpolation (dda_analysis)

3.) DDSCAT job submission via Linux utilizing multiprocessing, where the # of cores can be customized, effective radius is specified, etc. (dda-runner)

For questions about the DDA scripts, please contact tgog@umich.edu (Tarun Gogineni) and ammclean@umich.edu (Alan McLean).
